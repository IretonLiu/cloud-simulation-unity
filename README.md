# Realtime Volumetric Cloud Rendering in Unity

A realtime volumetric renderer for clouds using raymarching. This project was first inspired by Sebastian Lagues Video on the same topic ([Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QOcCGI6xOU))

This is a reimplementation of the cloud rendering technique first demonstrated by Andrew Schneider in his Siggraph 2015 presentation [[1]](#1) /Chapter 4 of GPU Pro 7 [[2]](#2) on the Real-time Volumetric Cloudscapes of Horizon: Zero Dawn, as well as his Siggraph 2017 presentation [[3]](#3).

The above shows the results I achieve at the current stage, this is not a complete reimplementation of the techniques metioned above.

TODO:

- None of the optimization techniques mentioned in [[3]](#3) has been implemented yet.
- The lighting is not yet ideal.
